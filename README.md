# Overview
A Todo List Tracking Website.

The purpose of this site is to be able to build a todo list that keeps track
of a users current goals with the ability to update and or remove goals. This site
was also made to prove a proficiency in using an external database such as Supabase.

# Development Environment

I am using the Supabase Database to handle all of the external storage. I am also 
using the Sveltekit framework with svelte and tailwind to handle all of
The UI. Typescript is used to handle the servers and scripts.
